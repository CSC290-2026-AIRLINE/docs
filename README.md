# Airline Management System — Project Docs

This repo holds the shared rules every team (G01–G16) and lead follows. If it's not written here, it's not a rule — raise it with the Infra Leads to get it added.

## Start here

| Doc | What it's for |
|---|---|
| [`branch-naming-and-workflow.md`](./branch-naming-and-workflow.md) | Branch names, commit messages, PR rules, review process — read this first |
| [`backend-structure.md`](./backend-structure.md) | Folder structure for the `backend` repo, module boundaries |
| [`frontend-structure.md`](./frontend-structure.md) | Folder structure for the `frontend` repo |
| [`database-structure.md`](./database-structure.md) | Migration structure, naming, ownership rules for the `database` repo |

## Repos

- `backend` — monolith API, one module folder per team
- `frontend` — client app, one feature folder per team
- `database` — schema, migrations, ERD
- `docs` — this repo

## Non-negotiable rules (summary)

1. No direct commits to `main`. Ever. Not even leads.
2. Every PR needs 1 approval + code owner approval (enforced automatically by branch protection + `CODEOWNERS`).
3. Branch and commit naming must follow `branch-naming-and-workflow.md` exactly — PRs that don't follow it get requested-changes, not merged.
4. Don't touch another team's folder without that team (or a lead) reviewing your PR — `CODEOWNERS` will request them automatically if you do.
5. Cross-module API contracts freeze by week 3–4. After that, changing another team's API is a conversation, not a PR.

## Who to ask

- Branching/Git/CI questions → Infra Leads
- Backend architecture/folder questions → Dev Leads
- Database/migration questions → DB Leads
- Everything else → your PM/Coordinator
